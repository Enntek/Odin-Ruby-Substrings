# Odin Ruby Project: Sub Strings
# https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-sub-strings

This is another classic intro to programming exercise. This will test our chops
on string methods and iterating methods.

Description from page: 
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
